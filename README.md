# Zelqify-Resume / CV

## Introduction
Hello everyone, my name is Kuzey. I am 14 years old and have been interested in programming for 6 years. I am at an intermediate level in HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP, but I feel that I am quite advanced in LuaU. Additionally, I have a C1 level in English.

## Experience
As I mentioned above, I have been actively writing scripts for 6 years. I had a separate portfolio on DevForum, dating back to 2020; although there has been no activity in the last 2 years, there are more than 80 positive reviews.

## Projects
### AeroX 2024
This is a project I am currently developing. It features a custom aerodynamic system that is written to the closest real-world standards. What's interesting is that in this project, you can fly from Istanbul to Paris in a 3-hour flight using a quality tiling system that allows you to play on a map of the entire world, much like Microsoft Flight Simulator. This system was originally created by Widgeon and used in AirX 2020, but the resolution was very low. I believe I am the first to import this system into Roblox in a high-quality manner. This project also includes live weather data and even clouds that change shape according to the weather conditions. (Widgeon also supports me in this project)

For more details and images of this project, you can visit: .gg/aerox2024

### Glide API
The system that I described in the AeroX 2024 project for importing and visualizing 1:1 Earth surface shapes is actually based on a system called Glide. If you want to buy annual access to this system, we can agree on a price of $100/4000‚Ç∫.

### Berlin V2 (1.2M+ Visits)
In this project, I was not the main scripter and was only asked to do simple things, such as the object placement system and profession system.

### 1 Chance To Try
I was the only scripter for this project. This project is a parkour game similar to Tower Of Hell, but played with more than 60 pre-made courses arranged randomly. This project is 4 years old but I had to sell it later.

### crush people and steal their points
I was the only scripter for this project as well. The project was a game based on the trend at the time of doing something to people to steal their points. However, in this game, you had to click on a specific place to kill people, and your inventory had a hydraulic press selected to try to kill them. (Not continued)

### Dragon Ball RP: Resurrection (12.4M+)
An anime-themed game, I worked as a scripter for a short time and fixed major bugs, restructured the project, and organized the scripts. I also developed things like character design system, special superpower system, etc.

### LuaU NLP & Neural Networking
LuaU Natural Language Processing is a system inspired by Lua Natural Processing on GitHub. I am still developing the project, so I cannot give a definitive result yet. In fact, the system is a bit complex, but to give a summary, it is trained with sentence datasets, processes a sentence given by your computer, separates its features such as action, noun, punctuation, and turns it into a format that the computer can understand. So, you can actually communicate with artificial intelligence. With the neural network, the system is fed with a lot of pre-given data and then makes a prediction on the next data, like a system that can predict based on previous data. Neural Networking can be used in almost everything. For example, if you use this in a Dummy, you can train the dummy to avoid dangers, fight, by feeding it with the right data. As a result, the dumb dummy becomes smarter. (I will release the system as open-source when I finish it.)

### OrbitBox
OrbitBox is a plugin that, with about 4000-5000 different keywords registered in the library, quickly transfers a prompt written to it, such as: "Generate a cold weather with some clouds with an upcoming storm." A system similar to NLP extracts average lighting, color, and cloud data from this prompt and quickly transfers it to the game. The plugin has not been released yet, but you can watch a video of the version from 6 months ago here: https://youtu.be/xSoqB5Oqs1k?si=IsVh_FQViK_OqSOE

Of course, I have many other projects, but I can't fit them all here. üòÄ

## Payment
I accept payment in TL, USD, GBP, and if there is a tax, we can also agree on Robux.

For short-term tasks, I charge per task.
For long-term projects, it's upfront payment + weekly/monthly fixed payment or %. 

I do not work for free.

## Conclusion
Thank you for taking the time to read this, I will share detailed photos and videos of my projects that I couldn't include here soon. ‚ù§Ô∏è
